## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Project Demonstrates use of Repository pattern with Unit of work. 
The repository pattern creates the abstraction layer between database access and business logic. The generic repository pattern is used to provide common database operations for all database entities in a single class, such as CRUD operations.

The Unit of Work is a type of business transaction, and it will aggregate all Repository transactions (CRUD) into a single transaction. Only one commit will be made for all modifications. If any transaction fails to assure data integrity, it will be rolled back. 

ReactJs is used as front end to perform crud operations. which interacts with Web-API to perform operations.

Entityframe work is used to provide ORM, Postgres SQL is used as backend for persistant data storage.

## Built With
